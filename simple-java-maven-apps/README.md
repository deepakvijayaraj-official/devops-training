# simple-java-maven-app

This repository is for the
[Build a Java app with Maven] tutorial

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.
